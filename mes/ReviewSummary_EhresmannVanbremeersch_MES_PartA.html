<p>
These notes are intended to be a minimal account of the material introduced by Andr√©e Ehresmann and Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch in their 2007 book <i>Memory Evolutive Systems: Hierarchy, Emergence, Cognition</i>. I hope that the presentation is convenient for deployment of the ideas in others' own domains of interest. It hardly needs to be mentioned that the original text contains many interesting points which are completely unrepresented here.

    <li>Notions that can reasonably be considered part of standard literature (e.g. in category theory) are not defined.</li>

        <li>Information, structuring communication between agents</li>
        <li>Function, division of labor</li>
        <li>Morphology, development, or integration of a whole from parts</li>

<p>
<b>Iterated Complexification Theorem</b>. It may be the case that the composition of a sequence K->K'->K'' of complexifications is not isomorphic to any single complexification K->K'''.
</p>

<p>
In particular this may occur because the option realized by K'->K'' requires binding a pattern in K' containing complex links with respect homologies between patterns bound by K->K'.

<p>
<b>Lemma</b>. If H is based, any n-constructible link is also (n-1)-constructible.
</p>

<p>
A hierarchical category is based if and only if every morphism is 0-constructible, that is either 0-simple or 0-complex.
</p>

<p>
Based hierarchies are precisely those which are constructed level-by-level by a sequence of complexifications realizing binding options.

<p>
For a complexification K->K' with respect to an option Op, the initial configuration K is associated with material cause, the option Op is associated with formal cause, and the implementation or construction of the complexification is associated with efficient cause. Because of the Iterated Complexification Theorem, an iterated complexification K->K'...->K<sup>(m)</sup> may be said to have indivisible material/formal/efficient causes. This suggests that complexifications may be used to model systems with features which prevent them from being modeled by classical physical dynamical systems, for which the material/formal/efficient causes are typically separately identifiable.
