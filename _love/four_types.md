In the application of mathematics to society, what better place to
start than with love?  Without love, there wouldn't even be societies,
just isolated individuals.

By love, I don't mean romantic love, I mean love in general.  Romantic
love is a much more complicated thing that we should talk about
another time.

What is it about love that holds societies together?  It is not just
that people have good feeling about each other.  It is that people act
to help and support each other.  Thus love is really more about action
than about feeling.  To love someone is to give them food, give them
medical care, defend them from adversity, etc.  It does include having
certain feelings towards the person you love, as these feelings might
spur you to help the person, but the feelings are not the heart of
love: the action is the heart.

We now distinguish four types of love:

* Kinetic love:  To kinetically love someone is to actually help them
  substantially.
* Potential love: To potentially love someone is to be willing to help
  them substantially when the need arises.
* Ostensive Love: To ostensively love someone is to _seem_ like you
  love them.
* Normative Love: To normatively love someone is to feel _compelled_
  to love them.

### Kinetic and Potential Love

Kinetic love is the heart of love, actual substantial help.  Without
kinetic love, love would be useless.  What's the point of someone
loving you if they never _kinetically_ love you, i.e. actually help
you in some way?  Kinetically loving someone could be helping them
access things they need such as food and water, it could be giving
them advice and emotional support, it could be working to make
something happen which they want to happen, or something else.
However, if you love someone _purely_ kinetically, then this person
cannot rely on you.  What assurance do they have that you will
continue to love them kinetically when they need you to?  Maybe you
kinetically loved them just that one time for a reason that had
nothing to do with them.  That is why _potential_ love is also
necessary for love to be real.  In between the discrete acts of
kinetic love, potential love (i.e. the willingness to kinetically
love) retains.

Kinetic and potential love both rely on each other.  We would not
kinetically love unless we were willing to (i.e. we potentially
loved).  And we would can only be truly said to potentially love if we
indeed kinetically love when the need arose.  Kinetic love is the
actual act of love, but the intentionality of the act resides in
potential love.  Though in a sense kinetic and potential love are
different types of love, they are really two aspects of love itself,
because one could not possibly exist without the other also existing.

### Ostensive and Normative Love

To ostensively love someone is to _seem_ like you love them.  This
includes shows of affection, confessions of love, sex, and actions of
kinetic love that people know about.  We can make an Euler diagram to
illustrate the distinction between kinetic love and ostensive love:

{% include_relative svg/kinetic-ostensive.svg %}

I know that hugs and compliments do have a component of kinetic love,
but their main function is to communicate that you love someone,
i.e. to ostensively love someone, so I put them in the "ostensive but
not kinetic" part of the diagram.

The left part of the diagram, kinetic but not ostensive love, is
sought by some religious people, who try to do good things secretly so
nobody will say that they were just doing it to get a good reputation.
Cf. [Maimonides' eight levels of Tzedakah](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eight-levels-of-charitable-giving),
[Matthew 6-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:1),
[Qur'an 2:271](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=271)

A lot of writing on relationships focuses more on ostensive love than
on kinetic love, that is, more on _caring-about_ than on _caring-for_.
It is really important to figure out healthy ways to show that you
_care about_ someone (ostensive love), but it is even more important
to learn healthy ways to actually _care for_ someone (kinetic love).
We need to band together and help each other get food, shelter, and
other essentials of life, and defend each other against adversity.
Just showing affection is not enough.  I am not saying that ostensive
love is not important, just that it is not as important as kinetic
love.  The importance of ostensive love is that without it nobody
would know that you kinetically loved.

To talk about normative love, we must first talk about normative
forces.

For me to normatively love someone is for a normative force to exist
which compels me to love them.  Normative love is an essential
component of love, because it helps love maintain itself.  It is hard
to stop loving someone when you love them normatively, i.e. there is a
normative force compelling you to keep loving them.  It is also
involved in the genesis of love: a person will often start loving
because of a normative force to love, i.e. normative love precedes and
causes love.

Again, these four types of love largely rely on each other, so they might
be more aptly called _aspects_ of love.  They can stand alone, but
their existence alone is tenuous.

### Combinations of the Types

Potential love is willingness to love if needed, but which type of
love?  We can distinguish subtypes of potential love:

* Potentially kinetic love: The willingness to kinetically love when
  needed.
* Potentially ostensive love: The willingness to ostensively love when
  needed.
* Potentially potential love: The willingness to potentially love when
  needed.
* Potentially normative love probably doesn't make too much sense,
  because you don't choose to normatively love, it is something that
  happens to you.  Maybe potentially normative love could be defined
  as being ok with normatively loving?  I'm not sure.

Often we will not make this subtle distinction, and we will just speak
of "potential love".  This can be interpreted either as an unspecified
subtype of potential love, or as the willingness to love in a holistic
way that has all four types of love as aspects.

Similarly, ostensive love and normative love have subtypes.  I
ostensively normatively love someone if it seems like I am compelled
by a normative force to love them .  I normatively ostensively love
someone if a normative force compels me to seem like I love them.

We generally won't need or want this level of precision, but it is
important to know that it exists.  It gives love a
nice [fractal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), since
three of its four aspects (potential, ostensive, and normative)
include within them the full structure of love itself, with all four
aspects.
