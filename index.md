Hi everyone this is the Social Math homepage.  There isn't much here
yet but there will be sometime soon.

### Manifesto

[Here](/manifesto/) is the manifesto (so far).  Withhold your
disbelief until you've actually seen examples of Social Math (coming
soon).

### Theory of Love

I am currently typing up my theory of love.  Before this first public
appearance, it only existed in my mind, in a few pages of old
notebooks, and in the minds of friends that I explained it to.

1. [The four types/aspects of love](/love/four_types/)
2. [The two laws of love, their four caveats, and more](/love/two_laws/)

### What I did to set up this site

[Here](/technical/) is a technical description.

### Please contribute!

Issues and pull requests are welcome on the [github repository]({{site.github.repository_url}}).
