Hi everyone this is the Social Math homepage.  There isn't much here
yet but there will be sometime soon.

### Manifesto

[Here](/manifesto/) is the manifesto (so far).  Withhold your
disbelief until you've actually seen examples of Social Math (coming
soon).

### Theory of Love

I am currently typing up my theory of love.  Before this first public
appearance, it only existed in my mind, in a few pages of old
notebooks, and in the minds of friends that I explained it to.

1. [The four types/aspects of love](/love/four_types/)
2. [The two laws of love, their four caveats, and more](/love/two_laws/)

### Systems modeling language

Jimmy Mathews wants to develop a general purpose systems modeling
and programming language that would be applicable to the comprehension
of social systems. The powerful language of Memory Evolutive Systems
developed in by Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch in their 2007 book
seems like a good place to start.

1. [Review summary of *Memory Evolutive Systems* Part A, pages 21-142](mes/ReviewSummary_EhresmannVanbremeersch_MES_PartA.html)
2. Review summary of *Memory Evolutive Systems* Part B (in progress)
3. Discussion of computational implementation of MES (in progress)

Further reviews may summarize the Object Process Methodology (OPM)
of Dori and Crawley, the Universal Modeling Language (UML) or SysML,
or some of the key references of Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch like
the work of Nils Baas or of Robert Rosen in complex systems.

### What I did to set up this site

[Here](/technical/) is a technical description.
